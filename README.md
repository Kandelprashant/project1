Each student will be quizzed about 6 times in the semester. If your student id ends with an even number, you will be assessed in even weeks. If not, you will be assessed in odd weeks. Aim of the assessment is to encourage group work participation on a consistent basis and also to encourage learning the implementation (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, MySQL) skills. The implementation skills are required to get you ready for project 2 in the next semester.

Also refer to the document titled “AIH - Project Details ISY3002 2018T2.pdf” for your project specifications. You will need to have rough documentation of your previous/current week’s work. The viva questions will be related to the (rough) documentation provided by you. The documentation does not need to be structured or formatted but you need to be on top of the knowledge learnt in the previous weeks.
